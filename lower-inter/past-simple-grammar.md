#The Past Simple

We use the past simple tense when an action or situation happens and finishes in the past. We usually say or know when the past action happened.
*She called* me at the office *yesterday*.

How to make positive past simple sentences
The past tense is made from *subject + verb-ed*. Irregular verbs have a different past form.

I finished university in 2010 and I started a job in a bank. Then I left that job and I went to live in Japan.

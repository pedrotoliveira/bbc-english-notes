#The Past Simple

We use the past simple tense when an action or situation happens and finishes in the past. We usually say or know when the past action happened.
*She called* me at the office *yesterday*.

*How to make positive past simple sentences*
The past tense is made from *subject + verb-ed*. Irregular verbs have a different past form.

I finished university in 2010 and I started a job in a bank. Then I left that job and I went to live in Japan.

Examples:
-She *called* me at the office yesterday.
-Steve *went* to the US three times last year.
-Usain Bolt *won* the 100 meters in the 2012 Olympics.

*How to make past simple questions*
Past simple *wh-word* questions are made from question *word + did + subject + infinitive*.

Yes/no questions are made with did + subject + infinitive.

Examples
-Where did you go last night?
-What did Roald Amundsen do in 1911?
-Did JK Rowling write Harry Potter?


##Past simple negatives

We make the past simple negative with *subject + didnâ€™t (did not) + infinitive.*

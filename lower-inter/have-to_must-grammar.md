#Unit 5 - ‘Have to’ and ‘must’ (obligation)
##Meaning and use

===============

If you *have to do* something, it is necessary for you to do it. It’s a law, an obligation or a fact.

You *have to get* a visa if you want to go to Russia.
According to our agreement, we *have to send* these orders to our client today.
I *have to go* to the doctor later today.

If you *must do* something, it is necessary for you to do it, but this is often your opinion or a rule that you have made yourself.

*I must remember* to buy a birthday card for Alice today.

We see *must* (not have to) in formal written notices or rules that an organization has made itself.

All students *must be* at the examination hall fifteen minutes before the exam.

We can often use either *have to* or *must* in a sentence. But be careful! There a big difference in meaning between *don’t have to* and *mustn’t*.If you *don’t have to* do something, it isn’t *necessary* to do it, but you can if you want.

You *don’t have to finish* the spreadsheet today. Tomorrow will be fine.

If you *mustn’t do* something, it means *‘don’t do it’.* It is necessary *not* to do it.

Employees *mustn’t send* passwords by email.

I *mustn’t make* any mistakes this time.
(Must Not)
 
###Form

We use *have to / must + infinitive without ‘to’*. *Must* is the same form for all persons (I, you, he, she, etc.). *Have to* changes to *has to* in the third person singular (he, she, it).

**Positive**
>Karen has to get up at six every day in order to get to work on time.
>You must drive more carefully or you will have an accident.

**Negative**
>You don’t have to take a towel. The swimming pool provides them.
>They’re expecting us to call so we mustn’t forget.

**Questions**
>It is possible to ask questions with *Must + subject...?* but it is much more common to use Do/Does + subject + have to...?
>*Do I have to come* to the meeting tomorrow? (Must I come to the meeting tomorrow?)

###Take note: the future and the past

There is no future or past form of *must*. We use will have to (future)and had to (past).

It’s too late now. You’ll have to talk toher tomorrow.
All the trains were cancelled, so we had to get a taxi.
*Did you have to write* it all again?

#You've got to read this

In informal British English, we sometimes use have got to instead of have to.

    * We have to change the engine oil.
    * We’ve got to change the engine oil.

And in even more informal English we sometimes don't even say the have – so it becomes just got to. You might see this in text messages and on social media, for example:

    * Got to change the oil.

And there’s one more way to say this: gotta. It’s the most informal of all these forms.

   * Gotta change the engine oil.
